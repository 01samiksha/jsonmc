# Contributing to JsonMC

All files are valid json files: every key should be double-quoted.

The JSON output should be the default "pretty" json output provided by node, with two spaces ident.

When in doubt, the output should match the `JSON.stringify(data, null, 2)` function output. `data` being the contents of the json file.

## File Names

All filenames should be lower-case. Spaces should be replaced by dashes ("-").

## Actors

For now, all actors should reside on the /actors folder.

## Movies

Each movie should be added to its own year folder and follow the "File Names" rule (above).

### Storyline / Description

Should have the "storyline" or "description" key and should only be the official one. No third-party content. Only official content, please.
